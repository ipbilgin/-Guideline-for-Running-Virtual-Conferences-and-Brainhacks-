<p>Here we aim to collect advices and suggestions currated from the many previous years‚Äô project leaders and attendees as the best practices
of running successful, collaborative projects that would lead high impact and successful outputs in the given short amount of time. The
main aim of the Brainhacks is being inclusive, removing the borders and limits and increasing the information and experience exchange
between the members of the project members. In the light of these aims, we encourage and support each single individual to be part of
the whole event either as a project leader or attendee to get the highest benefit from the event.</p>
<p>This document will be developed over time with the feedbacks. Please bear with us, we will work on finishing the document soon. In the mean
time please go through the below links that provides good starting points in working in and leading an open science projects collaboratively.</p>

<h1>Leading a Virtual Project üï∏üåê<a class="headerlink" href="#leading-a-virtual-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h1>
<p>Leading a hackathon project comes with a set of responsibilities, coordinating skills and ability to create a welcoming environment especially for the newcomers. Usually newcomers are highly likely to lack information about where to look for the right sources, tools and answers to their questions. They might be lacking the understanding of what is a Brainhack project means and how to contribute to the project during and after the event finishes. They might need a clear guidance and pointers from the start to the end. As the project leader you should have clear project goals, a set of skill sets that you desire to get contributions toward, the list of tasks to assign to the team members, and an accompanying time schedule that would allow both finishing the tasks accordingly and allow project attendees to engage with the other events through the Brainhack (eg. Trainracks, coffee breaks, biological needs, family duties, resting). Please always keep that in mind that, once you were a new comer too. Be polite, respectful, and show your support to the attendees.</p>
<p>As a project leader, it is recommended to keep your projects as broad as possible to give contribution chances to the researchers across many different backgrounds and career levels: being inclusive is at the heart of project leading. You are expected to define the scope of the projects so you can invite participation and contribution to your project.</p>
<p>Every event organization comes up with their own rules and recommendations regarding the use of the tools and the scope of the projects together with how to address the main questions at hand, or how to pitch and run your projects: make sure that you read and understand those organizational requests and follow those rules.</p>
<p>Independently from the event itself, make sure that you always encourage and address diversity and inclusivity in your projects, to give place and opportunities to the attendees from all different types of career level, diversity groups and create platforms, chances to learn from them and contribute towards knowledge exchanges between each contributor. Make sure you are open to the ideas, listening to your attendees, directing them through the necessary paths to be taken to achieve their task and encouraging them to contribute as much as they can.</p>
<p>Once you create your team, you should be running the first meeting to share all the necessary details and listen to your attendees regarding their will in participating and their skill sets that they can contribute with. As the project leader your role is to coordinate the project with all the necessary elements from communication between the attendees, onboarding the newcomers onto the project, helping attendees to achieve a task and making sure the environment is kept welcoming throughout the whole event.</p>
<p>Before starting to your project and working group, please make sure that you and your team members are all read and clear about the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit">Code of Conduct</a>, and abide with the policy of the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="before-the-project-pitching">
<h2>Before the Project Pitching<a class="headerlink" href="#before-the-project-pitching" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Define the aim and goal of the project</p></li>
<li><p>Open a Github Repo or Google Drive folder associated with the project</p></li>
<li><p>Open a communication channel or share the details for how to communicate with the project leaders for further queries regarding the project, project attendance, and preparations before the hackathon.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare a README regarding the project, place a link to it prominently on your Github issue</p></li>
<li><p>Put all of the documentation, guideline, data files, previous codes regarding the project in your Github repo/ Google folder, place a link to it prominently on your Github issue</p></li>
<li><p>List the goal of the project explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p>List the roles/tasks required to complete the project
(List all the requisites from the team members/team member specs to make it easy to apply for your project.) Invite all possible contributor personas with various different backgrounds and expertise explicitly, to enhance inclusivity. For example, ‚ÄúWe need graphic designers to help us design the user interface. We need python enthusiasts to implement some new functionalities. We need novices for testing our interface and helping us write documentation.‚Äù etc.</p></li>
<li><p>List all the prerequisites for tools, software, containers to use in your project in order to give enough time to the project attendees to set their workspace ready before the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare quick tutorials or documentation that would help/facilitate the contribution from any attendee who does not have enough experience in the area or link to existing resources. Similarly link to tutorials and courses relevant to your project, so participants do not feel lost when aiming at taking a python course. Here, you can find a super nicely curated list to choose from (https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/tutorials-and-resources/). This will gain a lot of time to deal with installation/preparation related time lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a GitHub keyword pool/tags that are associated with your project for easy search/identifiability</p></li>
<li><p>Create a timeline of the tasks to be done during the event</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a communication tool to chat with your project members (e.g. https://mattermost.brainhack.org/brainhack/channels/your-project-channel)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a video communication tool to run meetings with your project members (e.g. meet.jit.si or discord.com)</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare a project pitching presentation that fits with the organization‚Äôs time limits and requests, and think about a range of skill sets you are looking for. At the beginning of the hackathon, you will get 2 minutes to present your project with 2-3 slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare rooms for unconferences, quick training sessions in your time schedule that would help with the less experienced attendees to benefit from and encourage the experience exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Create entry-level issues on Github, and label them as ‚Äúgood first issues‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>If you are aiming to run a project that already started with few contributors in, stimulate a team effort to welcome and integrate newcomers alongside the experienced team members so they feel invited to join, and know who would be the person closest to what they wish to contribute</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy easy documentation tools/processes that could be used and contributed by any attendees of the project, in order to keep the track of the project progress and keep everyone on track.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare a one-paragraph summary text that you can send to interested attendees that contact you via e-mail/ Twitter/ ‚Ä¶ Link to your readme and documentation if they have further questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for co-leaders! They do not necessarily need to be involved in the ‚Äúplanning‚Äù for the content, but they might be very helpful in taking care of your attendees during the project. Co-leaders should know about the tasks/ goals/ schedule before the project starts.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are documenting your project well enough for the further use and contributors in the future which will include all the necessary instructions from installation to building the source, from using to how to contribute with all the necessary dependencies and licences, extensions and example data and links to the related documents and sources. Keep your documentation as simple, easy read and clear as possible given your users/contributors will not be only experts from the field but such approach will help you to have more contributions from wider contributors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure every single contribution given by the members of the team are clearly listed in the documentations, repositories, acknowledgements and citings, with the list of the contributions given by those.</p></li>

<h2>Project Ideas<a class="headerlink" href="#project-ideas" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Hackathons are strengthening the community and promoting the exchange of the information and knowledge across the communities. Therefore do not expect to solve hard field problems but try to come up with a project that is missing in terms of the practicality of the methods or tools that will allow both you and your attendees to gain and learn from it and will provide practical use for the community.
Make sure that your aims to achieve with your project are realistic to obtain within the given amount of time and they do not cause any extra pressure on your project attendees.
Use the presentation format provided and requested by the hackathon organizing committee for your project pitch presentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-pitching">
<h2>Project Pitching<a class="headerlink" href="#project-pitching" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Keep the aim and scope of the project clear and understandable for the audience.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can invite a range of skill sets you are looking for :) so for people very unfamiliar with your research question, they still feel ah, I could contribute here</p></li>
<li><p>Share the contact information in your presentation which is visible to the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you know your order in the presentation queue.</p></li>
<li><p>If your presentation is asked to be shared with the organizers make sure you hand it in, in time.</p></li>
<li><p>At the very first hours of the event, you encounter with many interests and questions regarding your project so be prepared to welcome new attendees, repeat your explanations; direct team members who joined earlier to documentation/ the readme you have written</p></li>
<li><p>Be prepared to explain all steps verbally to all participants. Allocate time for that. Best is to have a centralized meeting at the beginning of the day where everybody listens.</p></li>
<li><p>Please do not forget, there are cases you might end up having less number of attendees for your project than you actually aimed for or even none. In such a situation please don‚Äôt get desperate/ frustrated at first. Because people might be checking with the other projects they might end up in yours. Therefore keeping the communication channels open would be the right way to do.</p></li>
<li><p>It might be a better strategy to not to stick up with elaborate explanations to the first few attendees that join, but rather having a well written and a brief project explanation document somewhere that you can point to.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure you follow the timeline you agreed regarding the break times and encourage your attendees to follow and respect it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you and your team members read and understand the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aE6vv67i9pzOUN7DTypqiAVUutXAijP7_jZTURHhAM/edit">Code of Conduct</a>.</p></li>

<h2>Running the Project<a class="headerlink" href="#running-the-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you and your team members follow the Code of Conduct in their interactions through each of the communication channels and platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you guide your team members to direct the help from the right team members to the ones in need.</p></li>
<li><p>To be more organized prepare a calendar/Gantt chart or use a todo tracking system together with the team members on the agreed term, in order to facilitate dissemination of the tasks and assigning due dates to each of the tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Be open to the questions and help requests from the attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>Be open to your project attendees to work on several projects and support free movement between the project contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>If the number of the members is sufficient to have the ‚Äòsub-team‚Äô, divide the tasks among those sub-teams to facilitate the collaboration (eg. arranging the meeting time). In this case, the sub-team can work on their task then meet altogether by the beginning/ end of the day to discuss the progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Run several social events like online lunch, drink, chat meetings to increase and encourage flexible exchange and interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>You could have one virtual room connected ‚Äúall the time‚Äù where people know they can reach you just like coming over to your table IRL, eg meet.jit.si/your-project</p></li>
<li><p>List the contributors with their contributions in your Github/project repository to make sure every attendee is represented (You could follow the example of the Turing institute, using their contributor bot (link), or just copy-paste the lines of code into the bottom of your ReadMe file and adapt to your team members (link to an example, could be the tutorials and resources repo for example)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you give enough thought to the suggestions and discussions regarding any aspects of the running/realization of the projects that come from any single individual from the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Give regular pauses to the project to revise the project‚Äôs progress, with which aims are achieved, and which tasks are remaining to be completed to refresh the minds and will give an award and acknowledgment about the work the project members did/doing.</p></li>
<li><p>In regular pauses, you might think of redistributing the roles again, to give everyone enough opportunities to contribute to the project and benefit from different points of view and expertise, which will also take a load of a single task from one person to conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Kindly encourage documenting the processes to share later on in your repositories as metadata to be benefited as the case study by the fellow researchers that aims to follow the same footpath.</p></li>
<li><p>As many projects do not finish after 3 days, we encourage writing a summary paragraph of latest progress into a continuous place (Google Doc or HackPad, or one synchronous GitHub issue) every once in a while, targeted at keeping the team synched even if a member has to take a short break from the project, and also as a good place to go for newcomers who would like to join but missed the start of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Such documentation will also help quickly gather together a report or a demo presentation at the end of the event.</p></li>
<li><p>Give biological and social breaks throughout the event to give your team members enough private time schedules and some spaces to socialize.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure neither you as the project leader or any of the project members behave demanding regarding finishing the tasks that would exhaust any team members including you and prevents the main aspect of participating in the hackathon project.</p></li>
<li><p>For virtual events, many team members might have other obligations (child care, lab meetings, doctors‚Äô appointments) that make them drop out of the project from time to time. - Encourage your attendees to share when they‚Äôll be off beforehand, and take it into account when distributing tasks and tracking progress on subtasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if you prepare many documents about project goals (README, time schedule, links to relevant resources,‚Ä¶), attendees might not read them, but demand you to explain it to them in person. Schedule enough time at the beginning of the project and at the start of each day to centrally explain the goals for the day. Preparing those documents might help you get a clear idea about your plans and goals, but you need to be able to quickly summarize them to your attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>People from other time zones might spontaneously ask you if they can join you. Be prepared that those people will join you at much earlier/ later times of the day, and might be disappointed if you stop your daily work on the project earlier/ later than they would do given their time zone. Consider this in task allocation. You might have to explain your daily goals etc. separately to them. This is quite some extra work. Thus, consider just saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and keeping a project restricted to your own time zone.</p></li>
<li><p>For virtual hackathons, your attendee might be dropping in and out because they have other responsibilities over the day (lab meetings, doctors‚Äô appointments,‚Ä¶.). To avoid inefficiencies due to such irregularities in contributions it is better to make a schedule (spreadsheet) of the days, ask participants to indicate their availability, allocate tasks accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of a change in the schedule of the project, plans make sure you notify the project attendees well advanced.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the project time plan allows flexible movements across the time to give a chance to all attendees to attend train tracks or their personal commitments as necessary.</p></li>
