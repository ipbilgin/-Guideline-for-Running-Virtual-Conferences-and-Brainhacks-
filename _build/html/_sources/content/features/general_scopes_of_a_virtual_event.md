# General Scopes of Virtual Events
## Identifying the Organizing Team
The organizing team and roles should be clearly identified and publicly available. If there is a central organization, such as in the case of OHBM and Brainhack Global, managing the event worldwide, this information should be clearly transmitted, as well as any changes that are necessary to it in case of contingencies. The minimum amount of information required could be:

- Complete name
- Institution
- Role at institution
- Role at the event
- Contact information (email address)
- Personal contact details (such as the email address) should remain strictly private to the organizing team.

The details about the organizing team should be kept in some private but shared resource. This eases the information flow, allows to compute or keep track of statistics, and allows people managing the events in subsequent editions to have access to it in case of need. A list in a file kept on a shared drive can be such a resource; a mail inbox, however, cannot be considered as such, even if it can be accessed by multiple people.

## Inclusivity and Diversity
Compared to the virtual events, physical conferences come with additional challenges on diversity and inclusivity matters both on the speakers and attendee level. Primary caregivers with various family duties, people who are affected by gender bias, with disabilities, attendees from countries under a travel ban by the hosting country, attendees who are lacking supplementary findings, from low budgeted labs, or from developing countries, attendees who are practicing religious activities or any type of seen or unseen disadvantages experience many disadvantages regarding their participation to physical conferences. Providing an online platform to run a conference brings various flexibilities in participating, (eg. on-demand vs off-demand), making it possible to overcome all those listed and many other disadvantages encountered during the physical conferences. 

Besides removing the sociological and economical barriers, the previously run virtual conferences also have proven to us its effective role in creating an engaging environment that would help to encourage the more interactive participation of the attendees. The tools used in streaming and the functionalities allow across attendee interactions in a more natural environment and lead them to run more topic-oriented healthy discussions that are supported by sharing the related resources and ideas for future collaborations. All these aspects can be challenging in physical conferences, due to the busy time schedule of the conferences, many others listed above but virtual platforms allow a more friendly and fair environment to the attendees regarding their engagement and participation in the event and creating a community consciousness.

## Code of Conduct 📜
A well-organized event comes with a good harmony between both organizers and attendees, in order to provide a safe and secure environment to make sure every single attendee profile is welcome and represented. Here you can find our Code of Conduct for running virtual events. As the organizer, before everything, your main responsibility is to make sure that you read and understand all the aspects listed in the Code of Conduct, and you follow and take into account each of those listed from the beginning of organizing the event until the end (e.g. creating your organizing team to the bringing the list of speakers together, from the selection of the Brainhack attendees to the recruitment of volunteers, reviewers for the proceedings, and abstract selections and if there is a restriction the selection of the event attendees, creating the event schedule that would cover all the possible time zones and audience profiles). [Important for conference leadership to come to agreement about the code of conduct, and the response from the organization to severe COC violations.]

Again, as an organizer, you should make sure that all of your speakers and attendees read the Code of Conduct, follow all of the aspects listed there no matter what. Please make sure that this is a community gathering at the end of the day and every single member of the event is responsible for the maintenance of such a safe environment.

In the case of wrongdoing, make sure that you explicitly make the contact points and communication channels known and available via sharing the info through your webpage. Make sure that you have a gender-balanced and responsible team to handle any reporting of the violation of the Code of Conduct, that will give fair opportunities and good support to the incident experiencers. Please also develop a handling mechanism regarding how to move on in the case of such an event (eg. removing that attendee from the virtual environment or others) to make sure that event unity is not distracted and such incidents are not reoccurring again. If you are not able to create such a handling team, please let the Brainhack organizing team. We will try to help you. 


## Community Help and Interactions 💬
Independent from how well you organized an event, there is always a space to get the community’s help. Please don't forget that the community is the backbone of all events. You should always seek support and help from the community because there are always people who are happy to offer their help with various related experiences to share and help with solving your problems quicker and with more alternative solutions. 

If you are aiming for the involvement of the community in your organization, make sure that you are announcing and requiring such help with a good amount of time ahead of the event so the volunteers will have a chance to make the necessary arrangements in their time schedule and you will get more volunteering offers possible. Make sure that you have clear communication channels to maintain communication with the volunteers. Well distributed and dedicated job tasks always help in managing the wide community. Make a set of planning documents that outline what tasks need to be performed by what date and circulate that with the volunteer group. Add people’s names to the tasks in the documents and make sure that people are clear about what is needed when. A good recommendation is to have a person dedicated to organizing volunteer activity and liaising with the organizers of the event directly to find who might be available to assist with a given task.

Please, do not forget that, even though these people come with their own will, they might not be able to offer their full time as much as you organizers. Therefore, once you do the task dissemination, make sure that you are not exhausting the volunteers and also give fair chances to each volunteer. Besides the distributed and organized tasks, before, during, and after the event, you might have very last minute emerging issues that you might need a community volunteer to take over from you. Please make sure that you always use an encouraging language and show appreciation when work is done for you. Because do not forget that, more is the merrier and there is always too much to learn and get from the community, and also give to them. So make sure that you always make them feel like a part of the team rather than someone who just does the laboring work. 

And make sure that throughout and at the end of the event, you acknowledge them in all possible platforms to honor such volunteering help, to encourage the future event organizers and volunteers to follow the same path and believe in the power of community togetherness.

## Organizational Time Management 📆
Event organization is a big responsibility that requires good teamwork and enough time span to bring all the necessary aspects of the event together. Please make sure that you are aware of all the necessary aspects of organizing virtual events, and you are ready for that challenge with enough time period planned. 

Similarly, make sure that you advertise the event well advance before the event so you can reach to a wider amount of attendees and audience, get enough registration and abstract submission, have enough time to review the abstracts submitted and give enough time span for your speaker-related adjustments are done, they are given enough time to get themselves familiar with the technology of choice for the streaming.

Create communication channels between your attendees and co-organizers that are maintained and updated well throughout your communication. Make sure you use social accounts well and frequently to reach out to your audience in advance of the event to give them enough buffer to apply for the event as speaker or audience. 

## Variety at the Program 🥰
As in the physical conferences, in addition to the talks and virtual conferences require many different kinds of structured events. Some of the following kinds of events will increase participant engagement, contribute to community growth, stimulate more types of interactions, and account for the physical needs of the participants. Even though the conference is happening digitally, it is always important to consider the physical and mental exertions of the attendees.

- Biological pauses
- Social events and breakouts
- Topic-specific discussion rooms 
- Journal clubs
- Book clubs
- Group hacking (peer-coding) sessions
- Scientific dating with fellow scientists
- Lunch/Drinks with Mentors
- QAs with Mentors
- QAs with Open Science Advocates
- QAs with ERC Advisers


Considering the audience who might have an everyday strict time schedule to follow based on their work/family life, please make sure to create an event plan that provides variation regarding the order and variety of the event types for each day. Hence this will make the conference more accessible and easy to follow for a wider audience. Even though you might provide the videos recorded and shared later on, they will lose the opportunity of asking questions, engaging with the attendees and speakers, and sharing the energy of the event. Therefore please do not forget that it is always important to make sure that you are showing that you are giving enough importance to create a diverse time schedule that will give enough opportunities to all.

## Keynote Talks and Speakers🎤📑
Virtual environments provide more liberation in many aspects that we face in the physical event organizations, such as having :

Fflexible time planning that would suit with the daily duty and family responsibilities of the speakers
More spread and flexible time plan through a week, rather than running the event in a very dense common 3-4 days time schedule. 
Aaccommodating speakers/audiences from all around the world making the recording of the talks available through platforms and providing pre/after QA channels to communicate with the speakers.
Providing platforms/flexibilities to provide the talk in a prerecorded way to liberate the speaker from the complexities of the broadband or time-restricted difficulties.
Providing a better platform for interactions between the speakers and the audience in a more friendly and structured environment (eg. question pools or shared sources and materials alongside the talk among the audience via chatting channels)
Reaching to a broader speaker and audience profile given the capacity of accommodation increases.

As in all conferences, independent of their virtual aspects or not, the below listed should set rules for balancing the diversity of the speakers. Such as balance in the distribution of 

- The geographical location of the attendee
- The career stage of the attendee
- The gender of the attendee
- How many times they attended to the event as the speaker or with an abstract (if there is a limit on numbers to recruit for the upcoming year)
- Disability condition of the attendee
- Race of the attendee

## Moderating the Talks 🧑‍💼 📣
Moderating the talks is one of the hardest jobs of the virtual conferences. It requires a dedicated team and good planning ahead of the conference starts due to the many aspects that are required to be put under control. 

Timing is important as always, it is useful for a moderator to start early to the session, make the notes ready, study the order of the speakers, make themselves familiar with the streaming tool, regarding how to call the speaker or audience to the stage, or if it is a recorded talk how to start the streaming, how to run the poll for questions, leading the Q&A session, in the absence of questions maybe directing several questions, or communicating with the audience via the ongoing chat along the stream. Details may differ based on personal preferences but depending on the presentation flow it’s useful to gather some basic information about speakers such as names, departments, and maybe the title of the talk.

Some speakers do not mind interruption during the speech and may let the audience ask questions any time, some speakers get confused. It is hard to organize questions in both settings. For the sake of management it is easier to put questions to the end so everyone can only focus on the talk first, then questions.

Due to time limit or in the parallel session happening people have a tendency to leave early without waiting so thanking speakers and the audience is the most neglected part.

It is always recommended to have a second moderator to maintain the chat room while the other runs the session. It would also give the flexibility to switch between the sessions to avoid any exhaustion. Similarly, in the case of technical difficulty at any end (speaker or moderator) or in the case of a wrongdoing, it is always helpful to have a second pair of hands to consult without interrupting the general flow of the event.

In order to use inclusive language, it can be considered to ask the preferred pronouns to make people welcomed and comfortable with their identities. While announcing the speaker due to cultural differences, or having a gender-neutral name, it may not be always obvious to infer the gender of the speaker. In that case, asking the speakers before the session should be the first thing to do. In case of last-minute changes or not being able to reach beforehand, using singular 
‘they’ to refer to the speaker would increase the inclusive attitude.

## Preparation of the Talks
Pre-recording of the talks brings a facilitating effect for running tutorial and talk sessions smoothly, giving a more flexible chance to the speakers to prepare their speech and run it in a more relaxed environment and whenever they have time. However, there are several points you might need to take into consideration when you agreed on hosting recording talks. 
If the speaker does not want to record a talk this should be left as an option for personal preferences. 
Get agreed on a file format for the recorded videos for speakers to provide for the ease of the uploading and running (regarding the streaming platform you will use). 
Ask your speakers to stick with the duration of the video based on the allocated slot’s time allocation. 
Ask for a professional captioning. It could be manual or using a provided software which would let the speaker to manually edit. 
Establishing a system for speakers to submit/upload their files easily would help the transfer of the files without a problem ( Dropbox, Google Drive, or a submission website). 
Give a deadline to the speaker for the submission date. This will help for you to move on with your organizational workload (upload/ordering etc ) and help speakers to make sure they are committing to the given time period as it should be.
Ask your presenters to check the audio quality of the presentation before submitting
Check the audio and visual quality of the video as soon as the video is submitted.

## Presentation Specs and Copyrights 📽
The presentation content might not be widely differing from the physical events, it is important to give guidance to your presenters regarding how they should be structuring their presentations and how the format and content might have to be adjusted to the virtual presentation. To be able to increase the efficiency in streaming and running the presentations you can prepare a sample presentation that is showing the better choice of the image/font size, color scheme, image/writing ratio to be kept across the slides based on the streaming/broadcasting tools specs. ( eg. streaming tools are having speakers video at the corner, chatbox on the side, caption in the below might narrow down the actual image of the presentation and makes reading or visual inspection more difficult etc. ). For this particular reason and man others, therefore you can ask your speakers to make sure they follow below advices such as:

Using the prepared presentation templates/guidelines in preparing their presentation.
to share the presentations with the moderator in advance to the talk in order to make sure in the case of any technical problem occurring a backup streaming can be put in place by the event moderator for live presentations or the content can be shared with the audience in both live and recorded presentations.
make sure the presenter keeps the timing of the presentation suits with the time allocated for the talk. 
The presenter to share contact details for further questions in their presentations (for both live and recorded talks)
Make sure they can use the streaming tools of the preference without any restriction or broadband problems due to the country-wise rules and limits.  
Using an inclusive language in their presentation. 
Being inclusive regarding the use of flash photography.
Being inclusive regarding the use of the images/videos/audios (Eg. spiders, scary or disgusting, or pornographic content)
Copyrights (the use of the materials should follow ? rights)
Required references to the resources are used
Content which is suitable with the Code of Conduct

Based on the field we all are working in, in the case of a need of using such media content, ask your speaker to give warning information ahead of the related slide to make sure that the audiences are given enough time to take necessary actions to avoid any discomfort. 

Virtual events also come with a set of copyright rules that apply to the event attendees. It is highly important for virtual event attendees to make sure that the following points are followed and the necessary actions are taken cautiously. Those can be listed as;

Taking a photo/screenshot/recording of any talks/presentations/chat room discussions should be avoided without taking the consent of the presenter and each of the individuals within that media.
Similarly sharing such media content in any social platform or with third parties should be avoided without getting the consent of the presenter and each of the individuals in such content.
Sharing the unconsented information/communication details of any event attendees/speakers with the public via social media or third parties should be avoided strictly. 

## Consent 📋🔍
If you are aiming to record talks or disseminate any materials with the audience, please make sure that you take the necessary written consent from your speaker under data protection law. Please make sure that you indicate all the necessary information regarding your aim of the use of the recorded or publically shared material and why they are required to give consent for with your speakers and your attendees and keep the consents in safe storage space.

Here you can find the consent letter template we created that you can use and amend for your own purposes to get the consent from your speakers and event attendees. 

In the same sense, by having the control of participants' personal data, organizers need consent to store and use this data. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the conference needs to comply with its technical and organizational measures to implement its data protection principles. Although proposed by the European Union, GDPR applies to a number of cases for entities outside the EU that target or interact with EU residents. Given the scope of the regulation, and as a general set of good practices for data management, we recommend following the GDPR and requesting consent from the participants.

## Event Time Schedule and Program 📅
Virtual events come with the flexibility of spreading the event on to different time zones and throughout the week, and they give a wider audience the opportunity to follow along. Scheduling requires a dedicated team that is accessible 24 hours a day to be able to manage the back and forth communication with the speakers and the organizers. Therefore make sure that your organizing team has members from different time zones who will be able to take over such responsibility in the lack of the others due to the time differences. 

Make sure that via your web page you share all the necessary information regarding each day’s time plans with the information regarding the speaker, related materials (eg. social account handles, a reference to the papers, abstract, etc.) However in order to avoid any type of virtual abuse and violence that can be done by the 3rd party attendees, make sure you do not share the links of the streaming, passwords, chat, and video channels publicly in any of the platforms but only with the registrants. 

If you are running parallel sessions, it would be recommended to create topic-specific sessions to make sure the right audience profile is attracted and gathered around the corresponding talks. 

Having an event dedicated and publically shared calendar that could also sync with the audience calendar of preferences would help with giving a structured program of the event you organize. The calendars usually come with the fields to share all the event-related information, eg. link to the video streaming, the title of the session, etc. Also, reminder settings would facilitate the event attendees to notify before the next session starts. If you use a calendar, do not forget to share the information regarding how it can be used by the attendees on your websites. 

## Time Spread Across Time Zones 🌍🌎🌏
If the event is aimed to cover different time zones, it is important to have a balance between the topics of interests and time zone spread. As a topic of major confusion, it is important to keep the covered time zones as clear as possible. Furthermore, it should be clear to attendees whether time indications are given in 24-hour format, or in 12-hour format with AM/PM.  

Besides the usual indicators (e.g. UTC+3:00 or TRT), you can include major cities that are covered by the time zones, for easy identification, and website widgets/scripts to display the time in the participant time zone. Some examples of helping tools are:
Timeanddate.com: Provides a page to display the event date in its own time zone and in the user time zone.
Every Time Zone: With a different way to show the time zones, the website allows you to share a link to the specific time of the event, and the user can check when in its own time zone the event will occur.
Are Meeting Yet allows us to schedule an event that will be shown (in the browser) in the time of the person who looks at it (using the local time zone reported by the browser).  You don’t have to schedule in advance, it can also be done on the fly by constructing the proper URL. Here is an example that can be seen.

If the scope and resources of the event allow it, it may be worthwhile splitting the event into a few, large hubs spanning reasonably close time-zones. These hubs will require a dedicated task force to run the event within each hub, and serve as the contact point for any organizational purposes. In the past, some events, such as OHBM Brainhack 2020, were split into 3 hubs: Asia-Pacific (APac); Europe-Middle East-Africa (EMEA); Americas.

## Sponsorships



## “Travel” Awards 🚀 🏆
Although you are aiming to organize virtual events, it is still possible to provide awards to the attendees or best abstracts. The correspondence of the travel awards at the virtual events might be provided as 

- Upgrade in broadband speed
- Equipment support (mic, camera, headset)
- Money support - registration fee waiver if the conference is not free
- Office equipment (eg. USB, desk, office chair, upstand pc holder, etc.)
- Mugs, water bottles, laptop stickers

## Breakouts/Social Events
As in the physical events, social events are one of the important aspects of the community gatherings in order to increase the bond between the community members, create a friendlier and relaxed environment to interact with the fellow researchers and give a break from the busy time schedule of the events themselves a bit to share spontaneous moments. Therefore organizing such breakouts would make the event more enjoyable and easy to follow. The breakouts or social events could be run in many creative ways as virtual platforms and even making the events more interactive and easy to join. Depends on the needs and intensity of event schedule the breakouts and social events can constitute;


- Virtual concerts/club/dance music streaming
- Lunch or drinks with Mentors
- QA with career advisers
- QA with Open Science Advocates
- Yoga/Pilates/Workout sessions 
- Mindfulness Training
- Child plays, comics, animation streaming 
- Family fellow scientist chat rooms
- Cooking sessions
- Unconference presentations
- Curiosity wonders/stories about the wonders of the world
- Book reading sessions
- Karaoke sessions
- Debate sessions (I’m not sure where this would go, but where to consider break out events like what Dan Lurie hosted past couple years where people could argue/discuss/complain about the state of the field)

Please make sure that throughout those social events and interactions, a moderator from the organization committee or voluntary helpers accompany the attendees to make sure the order of the event is provided well and all the attendees in these events follow the Code of Conduct. 


## Feedbacks 📋🗣
Collecting feedback gives a chance to grow the event with the contribution of the community to share their own perspectives and experiences with the event. For that reason make sure that you collect the feedback that gives the opportunity to capture the many aspects of the event that address both the technological and contents. Although many questions could be asked and the feedback could be collected via the form, keeping the feedback form as brief as possible would make it easy to fill for the community. 

You can use Google Forms, which comes with many different types of question types ( multiple-choice, short/long answer, scale, etc.) which would allow you to ask different types of questions. 

Please use the form to ask the experiences of the audience with the current format and their suggestions regarding how the event should be improved. 

Here we have two feedback form examples one used for Brainhack 2019 Global and Neuromatch 2020 events, so please take a look at and use those as a template for your organizations. 

## Collecting Ideas 💡

Throughout running your event you might need to collect ideas, create pools to vote some decisions or decide on the time schedule for meetings. Here we list several sources for your use that would facilitate running such discussions efficiently.

Community interactions are also an important part of the virtual events, in order to allow attendees to feel like part of the event. It gives a more relaxed environment to your attendees compared to the physical conferences, while allowing them to own the event and act responsibly. One way to promote it is to give a chance of interaction to your attendees via a publically shared “Session notes” and “Shared sources” documents and sheets which would allow the audience to take notes and record the sources shared by the presenter throughout the talks or given by the audiences via parallel chat. This gives an opportunity to the audience to be part of the event, it will also give a chance to those who missed taking notes of such sources or were not able to watch the talks live.

Similarly, if your streaming platform gives you an opportunity, deploying a question pool and question voting system will provide a fair chance to engage with the speaker and will create dynamic talk sessions that include the audience to a larger and more interactive event.
