# Pros and Cons of Organizing a Virtual Event 📁
Running virtual events compared to physical events comes with many pros and cons. However, being well-prepared ahead of the event should help minimize the risks associated with the cons, or assist in executing preprepared backup plans.
	
## Pros 👍
- 👀 The audience → increased diversity & inclusivity: 
Running virtual conferences guarantees a wider outreach, both during and after the event (through the recorded videos). The number of live Crowdcast viewers during https://neuromatch.io/ peaked at more than 3000 without counting the simultaneous views on Facebook and YouTube. Some possible reasons…       
🏡👪 Attendees don’t have to travel to go to the physical event. They can simply stay at home. They just have to make themselves comfortable in a chair and turn on their laptop; no pants are needed. They also don’t have to be present during the whole event. As a result, attendees can attend while taking care of their children, while cooking, while planning another activity/appointment in-between…

- 💰 Cheaper? Running the event online might come with lower costs due to several eliminated aspects of attending conferences/events physically (e.g. no catering, no event location, no traveling…). However, that doesn't mean that online events are cost-free. The total amount of an online event’s costs depends on:
operating costs: In the run-up to an online event, several decisions are made that affect the associated expenses, e.g. whether to use paid employees and/or volunteers, which (open source) online streaming platform & communication channels to select along with the necessary privacy and security measures, how to handle administrative tasks...)
associated sponsors
(additional) support toward its attendees: e.g. technical/childcare support, zero-cost registration…  
concept of the event: 
Example 1: 
If your event requires the presence of some commercial companies and/or start-ups, then some funding towards them might be needed. 
Example 2: 
If you decide to run a hybrid event consisting of both virtual and physical components, ... However, it certainly again depends on how the running costs are handled (e.g. laboring, an online platform used in streaming, administrational costs etc.), whether any sponsors are involved, or any funding/awards/child care support is offered or not, or depends on the concept of the event, if you need the presence of some commercial companies/start-ups to be represented in your event, then some funding towards them might be needed. So all those might add up to the all running cost. 

- 🌳 Environment → increased environmental benefits:
No traveling means a lower carbon footprint. 
Attendees can use their own supplies (e.g. reusable cups) & there is no need for printed program leaflets and/or badges, reducing the amount of waste.

- Setup → increased flexibility + healthier:
Using the online platforms for data streaming and interactions
Online platforms allow attendees to do multiple things at once which results in increased live interactions. 
💻 watching streamed talks: There are many different platforms listed in Technologies section that allows simulcast and save the streamed talks with some of them having additional features to make the simultaneous streaming on different media platforms (eg. Facebook, YouTube) that increases the event’s accessibility. Some of the platforms also come with features that allow asking & answering questions, running polls within the questions, inviting attendees to the stages, which provides tools to increase audience and speaker interactions as much as possible.

💬 chatting & interacting with fellow attendees: Some streaming platforms come with the chat feature next to the streamed talks allowing its attendees to live discuss and share content related to streamed talks. Similarly there are many chat tools listed in the Technology section, that allows instant messaging within the attendees and making the announcements to the public in a rapid way. 
📊 conducting polls/feedback forms: Online tools can be easily adapted into the online events to collect feedbacks, suggestions or in order to create polls on collecting ideas regarding the subject at hand. These tools give flexibility and efficiency in sharing/collecting ideas and run fast quantitative statistics over the collected inputs and declare the results. 

- ⌚️ Virtual conferences can support a 24h program structured across different time zones (e.g. specifying three hubs: Asia & Pacific; Europe, Middle East, Africa; Americas) allowing attendees and speakers/tutors to log in & contribute to the hub which suits their daily commitments most. For many, the resulting health benefits might be substantial; especially for those who would have to travel large distances to attend their prefered conference’s physical counterpart. Why? Conferences often target an international audience. As a result, many of the attendees might experience a 6 or even 12 hours time difference between their home and selected conference time zone. For example, Asian researchers attending a conference in Europe or North America. As schedules are often too tight to allow for a timely adjustment of individual sleep schedules, the increased risk of suffering an additional cognitive and/or metabolic burden during and maybe even after the conference is undeniable.
🍴 Conference locations often have limited choices for food, and often attendees are provided with often unhealthy options. Having conferences online means that attendees can make meals at home. Vegetarian etc.

- Might be cheaper! 
Attending in-person conferences means incurring a wide range of costs: including conference registration, flights, international Visas, hotels, and food. Taking three people to an international conference may cost upwards of 15,000. This cost is prohibitive for many in science and is hugely problematic for issues surrounding equity and ease of access in science.
Online conferences might remove some costs that might have come with physical participation (e.g. travel, catering, venue booking...) which would lower the costs of running the event relative to the physical events. However they might still require sponsorship agreements or registration fees to be collected to cover all costs for the administrational labor, implementations of the streaming platforms, and communicating channels to be up and running and also additional fundings, supports that are offered to the attendees.

- Fosters Collaboration. 
Although not necessarily, online platforms might create an easier means for some of those to interact and contribute to the event more easily.
Collaboration groups can be facilitated through the many online platforms for coordinated discussions (ie. Twitter, Slack, Mattermost).
Conferences happen typically once a year, whereas online conferences can meet repeatedly and collaborative projects may gain steam more easily. 

- 🙌 Increased community feeling → lowering the threshold for active participation: 
Friendly environment, equalized communication, and more interaction opportunities; More opportunity to get a wider community help; Less status aware; More support and friendly environments; Fair opportunities to all attendees regarding interactions
An opportunity to learn how to make this work. i.e. we will get better as we go
